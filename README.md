# Machine-Learning-in-IDS-Systems

This project reproduces key experimental results from the research paper: “Intrusion Detection Using Machine Learning: A Comparison Study” (Biswas, 2018).
The goal is to analyse how different feature selection methods and machine learning classifiers perform on the NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset.
